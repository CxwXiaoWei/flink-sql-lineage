# FlinkSQL Lineage
![Product.png](https://github.com/HamaWhiteGG/flink-sql-lineage/blob/main/data/images/Product.png)
FlinkSQL's lineage analysis tool supports advanced syntax such as Watermark, UDTF, CEP, Windowing TVFs, and CTAS.
The core idea is to parse SQL through Calcite to generate a RelNode tree of relational expressions, 
and then call RelMetadataQuery to obtain the field-level blood relationship, and finally display it visually.

## Features

* Support lineage relationships at both the table and column levels in Flink SQL.
* Support processing and transformation relationships for field lineage in Flink SQL.
* Visualized display of data lineage, showing the total number of downstream fields for a specific column.
* Simultaneously support parsing multiple versions of Flink.
* Automatically parse source code from the JAR and populate function information when creating a new Flink UDF.
* Support viewing reference information for custom functions.

## Architecture
![Architecture.png](https://github.com/HamaWhiteGG/flink-sql-lineage/blob/main/data/images/Architecture.png)

* Plugin-based design, with each Flink version corresponding to a plugin.
* Utilizing SPI and Classloaders, each plugin is loaded using a separate Classloader.
* Server-side designed using Domain-Driven Design (DDD) architecture.
* Frontend development based on Butterfly with customizations.

## How to Build
Prerequisites for building Flink:
* Java 8
* Unix-like environment (we use Linux, Mac OS X, Cygwin, WSL)
* Maven (we recommend version 3.8.6 and require at least 3.5.4)

```shell
git clone https://github.com/HamaWhiteGG/flink-sql-lineage.git
flink-sql-lineage
mvn clean package
```
